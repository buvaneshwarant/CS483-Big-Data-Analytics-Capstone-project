# CS483-Big-Data-Analytics-Capstone-project
The basis of this project is to formulate interesting data science questions and to analyze them using data analysis tools (such as R, Python, and Hive/Pig) in AWS and data mining algorithms (such as Association, Rule-Based, K-nearest) to discover patterns/ trends in crimes committed in the Greater Chicago area during past years. The data-set we used to study is taken from the Chicago Police Department which updates crimes records daily and is hosted by the Chicago Data Portal. The questions we formulated to study the data-set includes, but not limited to:
1. Explore the crime distribution across the various areas – is there a trend, if any?
2. Likelihood of crime being committed during a certain time – are there any?
3. Weapons used/ and severity of crimes across the various boroughs?
4. Pinpoint general time index ex. Season, month etc.?
5. Are there any crimes that are related?
